# Data Relay

## Relay Task
Write scripts to either

- output 
    - a team member's name
    - lines of script
    - total lines of scripts
- take output of preceding script  and output that appended by the previously defined output

Each script should be in a different programming language. 

## Approach
### Considerations

#### Persistence

Passing data between scripts could be done via

- piping
- files
- database

Options 1 is not available on `repl.it`, option 3 did not seem possible across repls -> files

Even that option is not (yet?) directly supported on `repl.it` and was implemented via manual copy from one repl to the next.

#### Language selection

- [`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
- [`Java`](https://www.java.com/)
- [`Julia`](https://julialang.org/)
- [`Python`](https://www.python.org/)
- [`R`](https://www.r-project.org)


### Realisation
Use unfamiliar language for simple task (initial step, first file): Java and Julia.
